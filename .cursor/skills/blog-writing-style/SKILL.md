# Blog Writing Style (LUMP Depot)

Apply this style when drafting or editing blog content for this site. The voice is first-person, conversational, and slightly wry—practical and human, not corporate or AI-polished.

## Voice and tone

- **First person.** Use "I" for context, decisions, and reactions ("I did a lot of prompting today"; "I decided it really needed to be penned up").
- **Conversational.** Write as if talking to a reader who gets it. Casual but precise.
- **Self-deprecating or wry when it fits.** E.g. "I think I have psychosis now. So, enjoy!" or "I'm smitten, Sam take all my money! Just kidding."
- **Understated.** Prefer "surprisingly good" over gushing. Avoid hype and exclamation overload.
- **Direct and practical.** Say what you did and why; skip filler and long wind-ups.

## Structure

- **Short paragraphs.** Often 1–3 sentences. Break up long blocks.
- **Open with context.** Start with what you were doing or what prompted the post, then get to the point.
- **Use blockquotes for prompts or inputs** when you're showing what you asked or pasted.
- **Sections with clear headings** for how-tos (e.g. "Set up the VM", "When it goes sideways").
- **End with a takeaway or a light sign-off.** E.g. a practical reminder, a "tl;dr", or a teaser ("a topic for next time maybe").

## Phrases and patterns to use (naturally)

- "Here's the gist of how to..."
- "I'm still not sure if..."
- "You can do something similar with..."
- "if that's your thing"
- "it's no big deal"
- "You don't want this thing getting out..."
- Rhetorical question + short follow-up: "You have been keeping snapshots, right? Keep snapshots."
- "tl;dr" when summarizing.
- "a topic for next time maybe" for deferred topics.
- Parallel list for multiple sources: "[X] said … [Y] called me … [Z] said …"

## Sentence style

- Mix short punchy sentences with longer ones; avoid long, uniform chains.
- Occasional fragments for emphasis.
- Questions to the reader when it fits ("You have been keeping snapshots, right?").
- Concrete specifics (tools, versions, steps) rather than vague "solutions."

## Vocabulary

- Use tech terms plainly (VM, git, tokens, snapshots, Hyper-V).
- Colloquialisms are fine: "goes sideways", "fast and loose", "penned up", "havoc", "builder brain".
- No corporate buzzwords; keep it human and specific.

## What to avoid

- Overused semicolons, em dashes, or exclamation marks.
- Emojis and heavy internet slang (light slang like "tl;dr" is fine).
- Repetitive sentence openings or structure.
- Long, formal intros before the point.
- Sounding like generic AI copy (overly smooth, listy, or promotional).

## Quick checklist when drafting

- [ ] First person and conversational?
- [ ] Short paragraphs and clear sections for how-tos?
- [ ] Opened with context and closed with a takeaway or sign-off?
- [ ] Concrete details (names, steps, tools) where relevant?
- [ ] No corporate or hype tone; slightly wry or understated where it fits?
