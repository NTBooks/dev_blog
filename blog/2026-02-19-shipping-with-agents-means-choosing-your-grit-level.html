        <p>Sure you can polish, and polish and polish some more. But deciding when to hone the thing and move on because
          it's sharp enough to do the job is a trick.</p>

        <p>Is this a 100 grit project with a few big features that needs to do a single task reliably? Think: Ax.</p>
        <p>Is this a 300 grit job where the tasks require a little finesse and have a lot of edge cases? Think: Pocket
          Knife.</p>
        <p>Is this a 1000 grit job where there is a lot of detail work that matters to the customer? Think: Kitchen
          knife.</p>
        <p>It's probably not a 3000 grit job requiring a mirror finish. This isn't a knife sharpening contest, it's an
          AI slop app.</p>

        <p>Remember, the higher the grit level, the more detail work is required. It's time and tokens, baby.</p>

        <p>Shipping really means deciding when to jump ship on the AI find-fix-deploy loop. Can you think of more
          features? Sure. But maybe wait until somebody asks for them or you'll end up with something too big to
          maintain a sharp edge on.</p>
