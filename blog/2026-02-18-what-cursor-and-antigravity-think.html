        <p>I did a lot of prompting today, so I thought I'd get a little self-reflective. I'm still not sure if they've
          fixed the glazing problem, but here was my prompt:</p>

        <blockquote class="lump-prompt" cite="">

          <p>If you're able to access all our chats today, please give me a 1–2 page summary of everything we worked on
            today and what you thought about working with me. What we learned. Anything we got stuck on. It's for my dev
            blog but I want your opinion.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          It gave me a long and surprisingly good summary of my day.
          Also, I think I have psychosis now. So, enjoy!
        </p>

        <section class="opinion-summary" aria-labelledby="summary">

          <p><strong>Cursor</strong> said I give clear context (terminal output, exact errors) so bugs are easier to
            find. I also push for the right fix, not just a passing test, and I care about how things feel for users and
            what gets shown in docs.</p>
          <p><strong>Antigravity</strong> called me a "High-Velocity Visionary." I switch between big-picture design and
            small details without losing track. I ask why something broke and how to make the fix solid, not just "make
            it work."</p>
          <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> said I think in systems and edge cases. I move fast, so I run into more
            integration issues in a day than some do in a week. In short: builder brain with architect instincts, and
            right now I'm stress-testing how far the infrastructure can go.</p>

            I'm smitten, Sam take all my money! Just kidding.
            The tl;dr is that I'm getting a lot out of these $20/month subscriptions and I think as long as they keep
            offering them I'm going to keep bouncing between girlfriends... I mean agents.
          </p>
          <p> I typically stick to one
            agent type per project which has the added bonus of keeping my global conversation history focused!
          </p>
          <p>
            Project bleedover is a major issue, especially when you have multiple clients... a topic for next time
            maybe.
